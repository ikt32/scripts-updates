# License Generator

License Generator enables usage of (select) scripts by ikt. It checks if you are eligible for a license
through Patreon. If you are, it generates a unique license for your system.

Programs and scripts that require this license will detect this license and automatically use it.

## Features

* Unrestricted number of activations on any number of systems as long as eligible<sup>[[1]](#notes-1)</sup>
* License stays forever valid for *activated system configuration*<sup>[[2]](#notes-2)</sup>
* Scripts are 100% offline regarding license: everything stays on your system<sup>[[3]](#notes-3)</sup>

(Check the [Notes section](#notes) for more information.)

## Usage

1. Make sure the game is closed.
2. Launch `LicenseGenerator.exe`.
   1. If an existing license is present, it will warn, and backup the old license if you want to create a new one.
3. Log in through Patreon in the opened window.
   1. If the window does not open or if you are logged into an eligible Patreon account in a different browser,
   the URL in the browser or in the tool can be copied and pasted into another browser.
4. If you are eligible,
   the license generator will now generate a license file (at `%localappdata%\ikt\License\`).
5. The license generator is now finished and can be closed.
6. The game can now be started, and the installed scripts automatically pick up the license.

## Notes

1. <a name="notes-1"></a>
   You're eligible when you have an active pledge with the account that authorizes License Generator.
2. <a name="notes-2"></a>
   Swapping out multiple core components may cause the system to be expired for the license.
   Re-generation of the license is needed in this situation.
3. <a name="notes-3"></a>
   Only the License Generator connects with Patreon to check if you are eligible.
   The scripts only check the license file locally.
   The scripts themselves may or may not individually check select GitHub repositories to notify for
   updates or to pull in data required for the script to work.

The Author will not answer any questions or provide support related to using modifications in GTA: Online or with third-party multiplayer mods.

### 4. Availability and online reliance

* **Reliance on Third-Party Services:**\
  The License Generator relies entirely on the Patreon API to check the User’s subscription status and generate licenses. The Author cannot guarantee the availability or reliability of the Patreon API. The User is responsible for ensuring they can access Patreon services normally. Using tools like VPNs or proxies may interfere with the License Generator, and the Author is not responsible if these tools prevent communication with Patreon.

* **Connection Issues:**\

### 5. Limitations of liability

* **No Liability for Damages:**\
  Under no circumstances will the Author be liable for any direct, indirect, or incidental damages that result from the use or inability to use the Software, License Generator, or License, including damage to hardware, loss of data, or software conflicts.

* **Indemnification:**\
  The User agrees to defend and hold the Author harmless against any claims, damages, or liabilities resulting from misuse of the Software, License Generator, or License.

### 6. Intellectual property rights

* **Ownership:**\

### 7. Termination

  If the User violates the terms of this Agreement or cancels their subscription, they will no longer be eligible to generate new licenses.

Access to the Author’s personal projects and the License Generator is a privilege extended during the subscription period.

### 8. Renewal of licenses due to system configuration changes

* **License Renewal Requirement:**\
  If a machine’s system configuration changes significantly and the License stops working, the User must be subscribed to the Author’s Patreon to generate a new License. Licenses will not renew automatically, and the User must ensure they are subscribed when renewing a License.

* **Upgraded License Requirements for New Versions:**\
  The Author may release new software or updated versions of existing software that require a different or upgraded license to function. Users must generate a new license using the updated License Generator while subscribed to the Author's Patreon in order to use these new versions. This new license does not invalidate the old license; both the new and old licenses can exist together, allowing the User to continue using software activated with a previous version of the license alongside updated versions.
