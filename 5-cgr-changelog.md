# Changelog for Custom Gear Ratios for GTA V

## 2.0.0

Main changes:

* Added support for GTA V Enhanced.
* Added indicators for supported game builds for FiveM.
* Overhauled configuration management. CGR is now aware of pending changes and shows a small warning.
* Added an option to toggle between metric and imperial units, useful when defining top speeds per gear.
* Moved the CVT option from global to configuration specific.

Config/Format changes:

* Existing `settings_general.ini` still compatible, but beware that only `EnableNPC` and `Unit` are used.
* Existing configurations in XML format are still compatible. New CVT parameters are added when saving.

## 1.0.1

* Add generic auto-loading for models
  * You can now save a generic preset that applies to all cars of that model. It is overriden by a license plate specific preset.
* Add an option to override changes GTA makes to the car ratios
  * When tuning in Los Santos Customs or using a trainer, the gear ratios can be reset. This option checks the ratios every second and re-applies them if the game has changed them during that time.
* Add a feature to remove gear ratio presets in the Load menu
  * You can now mark gear ratios for deletion. The ratios are removed when closing the menu. <b>Caution: The files are permanently removed from disk!</b>
* Experimental: Add a custom CVT (continuously variable transmission) option
  * Script emulates a CVT when setting a non-CVT car to have only one gear
* Disable gear ratio changes for real CVT cars
  * Cars that have the CVT handling flag set only have one gear and the game doesn't shift up, so changing the ratios won't have any effect.
* Add an option to enable or disable notifications
* Fix an issue where the save prompt reads an enter too early, closing it too early
* Fix an issue where DriveForce is overwritten, causing cars to lose all power
* Change how filenames are generated

## 1.0.0

* First release
