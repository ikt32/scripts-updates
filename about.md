# About

Hello, I'm `ikt`, software engineer and car enthusiast.

This website contains documentation for my Patreon-supported scripts,
listed on the [main page](./){:target="_blank"}.

My aim with my scripts is to bridge the gap between simracing and
Grand Theft Auto (V), a massive free-roaming game with many activities.

"Oversteer Engineering" was chosen as site and business name, because in-game
you'll probably be drifting around a lot, and the name still is relevant if
and when newer games get released for which I also want to create something.
